Django Memcache Admin
=====================

Memcache administration tools for Django.

* Show cluster information, optionally auto-updated.
* Show a server's statistics.
* Show a server's slabs.
* Flush the cluster (GUI and CLI).
* Compatible with default admin and Bootstrap.

Install
-------
Install via pip::

    pip install django-memcache-admin

Add ``memcache_admin`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py`` file.

Update the database::

    python manage.py syncdb

The application will now be available in the admin panel.


Permissions
-----------
To use this module, a user must have access to the Django admin panel and have *change* permissions on the
``memcache_admin | Memcache Dashboard`` model.

Setting *add* or *delete* permissions has no effect, they are always false.


Settings
--------
In your ``settings.py`` file, you can add a dictionary called ``MEMCACHE_ADMIN``.

The following key/value settings are available:

REFRESH_RATE — integer
  Sets the auto-update refresh rate in milliseconds for the server information in the dashboard.
  Note that auto-updating must still be activated in the dashboard for this to take effect.
  If set to ``None``, refreshing will be disabled (unavailable in the dashboard interface).
  Default is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

CACHE — string
  The cache definition to use. Default is "default".


Commands
--------
Available management commands.

flushmemcache
  Invalidates all existing memcache items, so that occupied memory will be overwritten by new items.


Compatibility
-------------
* Tested on Django 1.6 and 1.7
* For best results, `python-memcached <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-memcached/>`_ should be used.
* `pylibmc <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylibmc/>`_ can be used, but not all information will be available.

This library is compatible with python 2 and 3, however the memcache packages above are only python2 compatible.
